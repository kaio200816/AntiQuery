This plugin was made to block "query" query from server monitoring sites to prohibit querying of pocketmine plugins, currently the code is in pocketmine 5.0.0 +

Plugin Purpose:

The plugin prevents the list of plugins installed on the server from being exposed when the server is queried by external tools. By setting the plugin list to empty, the server "hides" all running plugins, improving the security or privacy of the server.
